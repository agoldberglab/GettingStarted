## Public datasets:
- 1000 Genomes resequencing data can be accessed here: https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/data-collection/30x-grch38 

## Software:
- plink v1.9 https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/
- ADMIXTURE v1.3.0 https://dalexander.github.io/admixture/download.html
- R v3.6.1 https://www.r-project.org/

## Markdowns within this directory:
- [Prep1000G_MalariaProject_summary.md](./Prep1000G_MalariaProject_summary.md) written Oct 2020 to assist with looking at possible selection at malaria-interacting loci in 1000G admixed populations. contains some guidance basic PLINK commands and PCA/ADMIXTURE.
